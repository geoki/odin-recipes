# odin-recipes

This project is a simple website that links to three recipes of pasta dishes I found interesting.

The goal of this project is to apply the basics of HTML such as: formatting, incorporating links and images, and using unordered and ordered lists.

Another goal of this project is becoming familiar with Git.
